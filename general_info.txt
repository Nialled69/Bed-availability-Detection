The dataset (link provided in the repository) includes 428 images.
The Hospital-beds are annotated in YOLOv8 format.
Check the ``data.yaml`` file present within the dataset for more information.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1280x1280 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
