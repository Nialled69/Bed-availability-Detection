# 🏥 Detection of Availability of Beds in Hospital by checking through the CCTV footage using YOLOv8

### 📚 Overview

- This project implements a hospital bed occupancy detection system using [YOLOv8](https://yolov8.com/) object detection system.
- It detects both hospital beds and persons, and uses an IoU (Intersection over Union) function to determine if a bed is occupied or not.
- Then it updates the availability of beds in hospital database in real time.
- The system can work on images (JPG/PNG) and videos (MP4/MKV), and is optimized for real-time video analysis.

### 🚀 Why YOLO?

- [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm.

- It is fast, accurate, and lightweight — perfect for scenarios like hospitals where real-time monitoring is critical.

- Compared to traditional CNN-based object detection, YOLO brings:
    - Faster inference
    - High detection accuracy
    - Better performance even with fewer datasets
    - Simpler deployment on CPU or GPU

### 🤍 What YOLO Version?

- YOLOv8m.pt (medium model) for person detection (from Ultralytics pretrained COCO model) (COCOMO)

- Custom trained YOLOv8 model (best.pt) for hospital bed detection.

Training Details for Bed Detector:

- Framework: Ultralytics YOLOv8

- Input: ~2000 images of hospital beds (manually custom annotated)

- Output: best.pt model file after training epochs

### 🧹 How Detection Happens

- Step 1: Detect all hospital beds in a frame using the custom YOLOv8 bed model.

- Step 2: Detect all persons in the same frame using the YOLOv8 COCO pretrained model.

- Step 3: For each detected person:

    * Check if they are standing (ignored if height > 1.8 × width).

    * For lying persons, calculate IoU with each detected bed.

    * Assign the person to the bed with the highest IoU (if IoU ≥ 0.08).

- Step 4: Count all assigned beds → then count the availaible beds.

    * Free Beds = Total Beds - Occupied Beds

---

### 🔠 How Matching (Assignment) Works

- IoU (Intersection over Union) is calculated between:

    * Person bounding box

    * Bed bounding box

- IoU Formula:
`IoU = Area of Overlap / Area of Union`

- A threshold of 0.08 is set — if IoU ≥ 0.08 → person is assigned to that bed.

This approach ensures:

- Only lying persons are considered

- Only meaningful overlaps are assigned

---

### 📈 Matching Accuracy

- Matching Rate = (Correctly assigned beds) ÷ (Total beds detected)

- During testing, typical matching accuracy is around 85–90% depending on:

    * Camera angle

    * Bed layout

    * Quality of training data

- Errors mainly occur when:

    * Person is partially lying

    * Bed is occluded or outside frame

### 🎮 Real-time Video Detection

- Video frames are processed using YOLOv8 at resized 640×480 resolution.

- Multi-threading is used to detect on every 2–3 frames, achieving near 30 FPS real-time.

- Output visualizes:

    * Blue boxes → detected beds

    * Green boxes → detected persons

    * Red boxes → occupied beds

Free bed count and occupancy details are shown live.

### ⚖️ Possible Optimizations (Future)

- Switch to YOLOv8n (nano) for ultra-smooth 60 FPS detection.

- TensorRT acceleration for faster GPU inference.

- Track persons over time (DeepSORT tracking) to reduce detection overhead.

- Model quantization (FP16, INT8) to further speed up predictions.
